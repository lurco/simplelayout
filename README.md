# A simple, modern, responsive website layout in HTML and CSS (no JS)

The template adheres strictly to the principles of BEM methodology (Blocks, Elements, Modifiers - [BEM](https://getbem.com/introduction/)).

There is no functionality at the moment, just pure HTML and CSS. The structure is semantic, clear and lean and
the template allows for easy distiction between the elements.
